#### Future Features
* D.C. GIS has released new [JSON](http://opendata.dc.gov/) - will be implementing that soon
* Once crime data is working, restrict it to only those areas near user-placed markers
* App needs additional front-end styling
* Ideally, home page would have a 'preview mode' to provide users without a login some basic functionality. The preview map will display all D.C. crimes and provide users with the ability to view all crimes by type.
